With the rate of growth in the aging population research is advancing to meet the needs and demand.
This is both to fight diseases and disorders like Alzheimer's Disease, but it also means to observe how the aging process progresses and how to age successfully.
Aging people want research to focus on how to maintain independence and health though the whole lifespan.
