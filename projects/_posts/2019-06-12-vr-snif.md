## The world!

Unity designed simple demo and world
[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/xfMZ9TJ_XZI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfMZ9TJ_XZI "Vr Sniff")

- Uses teleporting locomotion with the daydream controller tried different methods of movement (tunneling, arm swing motion)
- Once the user approaches the flower a particle system is realease and the smell periferal is turned on.

## Housing overview

Overview of design and layout of aroma chem device housing. This will hold the physical components

![Aroma Housing](assets/img/vr_snif_post/aromachem5.jpg)

- The housing holds
    - RF-duino
    - 2 relay module
    - 2 LiPo batteries
    - 1 Usb battery pack 
    - 1 fan
    - 1 laser
    - Aroma resevior

- The circuir components and aroma mechanism are seporated by a center wall to create a smell chamber before the fan drives smell outside of housing box

## Aroma reservoir
The aroma resevoir is 3d printed with varying sizes for testing
The 3d model can be found [here](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/aroma-chem/blob/master/3D-Printing/Sample-container-height-X2vsX1.stl)
