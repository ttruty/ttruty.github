# Aging Research Technology

I work with aging research and I have crafted my specialty as the "device guy".
I am very involved in the current research devices that we use at the Alzheimer's Center.
These devices are mainly used in a epidemiological study. Meaning we collect data year after year of the same participants.
The devices mainly focus on mobility, but some are used to get at a more granular picture of cognition

I will name each device and give a short description I am not going to go into brand detail, just going to focus on the general characteristic:
1. Gait Test Accelerometer
	* This is a triaxial accelerometer used on a variety of specific movement tests: like sit-to-stand and 360-turns
	* Worn only for about 20 minutes for tasks
	* Sample rate of 100 Hz
	* Biomechanical Engineers used this data to craft analysis tools and find calculated measures like walking speed and body sway
2. 10 Day Activity Watch 
	* Also triaxial accelerometer but worn continuously for 10 days
	* Sample rate 40 Hz
	* Used to measure sleep metrics and activity level
3. Smart Pen
	* Optical smart pen that digitizes writing tasks
	* MMSE writing tasks and clock drawing
	* Time and writing data points
4. Sleep Apnea Testing Machine
	* Worn for one night on the hand and finger to get sleep apnea measures

The data from these devices is combined with the memory testing and health questionnaires completed during annual testing to see a whole picture of participant aging and health
