#  Simple Brain Game
## Developing a brain game

### Game overview
- A simple game design with two main branching options of working out the left or right brain.


- Once selected each side will allow for different options.
- Currently the Left(Logic) side of the brain has a chess game. Currently only allowing a two player chess game (Working on AI but that coding is a bit of a challenge). I was really happy to code the full movement of pieces.

- Right (Creative) side is a color finding game where you must select a different color box in grid of color boxes.

- The take away from this game is a persistent high-score

### Key take aways
- Menu navigation
- Sounds and persistent music and volume control
- PlayerPerf to save high-score

### Future Development
- This framework allows more games to be added and can be a general game navigational menu framework
