# Red Alert 2- Yuri's Revenge
## Play with friends and get annoyed but have a good time

[YURI'S REVENGE WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Yuri%27s_Revenge)

#### 1. Origin Account
The first (and most annoying) part of this tutorial is that you need an Origin account to purchase the Complete Red Alert Collection. There are other methods of obtaining the game that are less than legal, but I do not know how hardcore the authentication Red Alert 2 on the server is. So I will say just pay the $20 to our EA overlords and move on.

[EA STORE](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store)
- Register a new account on the bottom left if you don't already have one.
NOTE: Remember you password as resetting or working with Origin support is [notoriously difficult.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/906ck7/ea_support_is_the_worst/) 

#### 2. Purchase the games
The next annoying part thanks to Origin is to purchase the games [HERE](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-the-ultimate-collection)
- When you click GET THE GAME it takes you to a page where it looks like you need to buy a subscription in order to play... you do not. click the button on the bottom to just buy the game.

![Buy CnC collection]({{ "/assets/img/yuri-post/buy-yuri.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Follow the instructions to buy the game. 

#### 3. Get Origin Game Launcher
In the year of our lord 2020, if you make a game; you also need to make a game launcher... That is where we are now. So in order to download the game you purchased through Origin you now need to download the Origin game launcher. THANK YOU EA. 

[Download EA Origin Games Launcher](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/download)

Follow the instructions and install. The launcher.

#### 4. Sign into Origin Launcher and get the Games
Once the launcher is downloaded boot that up and after you sign in, move to **Games Library**

![Launcher]({{ "/assets/img/yuri-post/download-game.jpg" | absolute_url }})

If you right click on the game you want there should be an option to download. If you do not see any games here, you might have not purchases correctly if you know you did try re-launching the launcher. IF STILL NO GAMES, CONTACT ORIGIN SUPPORT AT YOUR OWN RISK (see above)

#### 5. CnCNet
The game server that enables online play today (in 2020 at time of post) is called CnCNet.
You need to download this program in order to create or join a server

[CnCNet Yuri Revenge Download](https://cncnet.org/yuris-revenge)
- Follow the instructions and install the program, I made some desktop shortcuts to make it easy to find the games. 

NOTE: I had a friend who had a error as the game Yuri and this CnCNet program where on two different drives so you might need to troubleshoot some issues.

#### 6. Launch Game

Launch Yuri's Revenge with the icon on desktop **Yuri's Revenge CnCNet** 

![YR-icon]({{ "/assets/img/yuri-post/yr-icon.jpg" | absolute_url }})

This boots up a screen you may be familiar with:

![YR-Game]({{ "/assets/img/yuri-post/yr1.jpg" | absolute_url }})

- You can play single player from here or go online. If you choose to play online(you should). Click play online and enter your name. In the lower left side of the screen you can create a game or join one. NOW YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS!
